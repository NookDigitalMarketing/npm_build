	<p>An education in Australia mandates that all students study at least one performing arts subject from early childhood education (pre primary) through to the end of year 8.</p>	
		
	<p>With a strong focus on education through kinesthetic learning , Creative Moves' dance workshops are an ideal incursion activity for primary  and secondary schools.</p>	
		
	<p>Kinesthetic learning can be defined as a learning method in which learning takes place through students carrying out physical activities (fun maths!), rather than listening to an instruction or passively observing demonstrations.</p>

		<p>Professional learning for teachers is provided through assessment criteria guidelines and assistance with assessments, to ensure that educators meet the prescribed requirements.  Teachers of all levels of experience from generalist to qualified dance teachers can be provided with the skills and resources to deliver the syllabus on their own.</p>
